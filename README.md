# Chuck Norris App

is single page application that is using Chuck Norris API ((https://api.chucknorris.io/).
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.1.

# Description
When the user lands in the app they should see a list of categories (capitalised) coming from
the API. Each category is a button. When they click on the category button, a modal appears with a random joke from this category. Users can load another random joke clicking the
“Another one” button below the joke. To go back to the categories screen, they can click close the modal.
